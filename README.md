# Challenge-4-Wilson-JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

The challenge for week 4 was to add a password generator to the existing html page.

- What was your motivation? This was challenging, the quiz itself took a bit to set up.
- Why did you build this project? It was an interesting challenge to use JS to dynamically update html content
- What problem does it solve? The webpages will provide a function quiz, keep the user score and save a separate scoreboard
- What did you learn? A ton to be honest. Getting handles on html objects and saving/editing localStorage variables were the big take aways.

The main portions of the page that intended.

- 3 question quiz
- quiz keeps track of right/wrong answers throughout
- a timer for each question that resets on the start of a new question
- writes the value of the score to a localStorage variable
- captures the user's initials and stores it as a localStorage variable
- builds arrays in local storage for both the score and the user
- displays the scoreboard highlighting user initials and score
- clears the scoreboard upon request

## Installation

This will work as a stand alone webpage, no installation is required.

Page consists of the following

- index.html
- scoreboard.html
- style.css (./assets/css/)
- script.js
- script2.js (scoreboard js)

Thanks to the folks at both MDN and W3. The walkthrough on math.floor, appending new values to an array, and converting arrays back into strings were particularly helpful.
